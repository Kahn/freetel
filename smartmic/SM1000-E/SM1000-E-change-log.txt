1.  [X]	Change PTT sw. to e-switch LC2259OANP.

2.  [X]	Change POWER SW to e-switch LC2259EENP.
	
3.  [X]	Change SPKR CONN J4 to CONN-BOOM-XH-2A.

4.  [ ]	Added part outlines to layer tDocu for documentation.
		In progress, adding to outlines in time.

05/18/15

5.  [X]	Problem with SPKR OUT conn. Shorts output when stereo jack used.
        + as per Josh Mesaline email, suggest resistors to tip and ring
          so a short doesn't upset amp.  Does this mean it will work with
          mono and stereo plugs?  If stereo only we should note this in UG.

		Changed connector to low profile locking type  RGB

6.  [ ]	TrimPOT holes, location off by 1mm.

7.  [X]	U1, CPU pins extend to the end of the pads.
		Corrected RGB

8.  [X]	Lad pattern for LEDs too large. I will look into this. RGB
		Land pattern size recommended by vendor. If too large, need suggestion.  RGB

9.  [X]	SW5 land pattern too wide. Check specification.
		Corrected package RGB

10. [X]	C32, C59 footprint too short.
		corrected package  RGB

11. [X]	L1 Land pattern too wide.
		Corrected package  RGB

12  [X]	CN4	Bubble after SMT(high temperature)
		No action yet. Edwin, can you find an alternative to fit? If different footprint, let me know and send specification so
		I can change it.(RGB)
	*****	Edwin reports other vendors parts do same. Action? RGB

13. [X]	R46	Easy to break R46 with handling.
			Add cement after production.
	*****	Note, I accidently hit and moved pot removing PCB from case. Suggest applying cement prior to soldering RGB

14. [X]	PCB	Problem reflowing CN10 USB connector.
		Make Breakaway 10mm (Edwin)
	*****	Vendor problem. RGB

15  [X]	PCB	Stencil too small.
		Make Stencil 52 x 52 cm(Edwin)
	*****	Vendor problem. RGB
	
16  [ ] Firmware   Better debouncing software for push button switches (DR)	
                   could be: more solid indication of in DV mode, like two beeps, two flashes

17  [ ] Enclosure  Move "Speaker Volume" text lower to clear volume control knob

18  [ ] Enclosure  Some variablility in gap between lid and front panel, gap is
                   sometimes wider on one side than another (Edwin)

19  [X] PCB	change power led from red to green, clip/error led from amber to red? 
		LED1	GRN
		LED2	RED
		LED3	GRN
		LED4	RED
	*****	DO we need new LED packages?

20  [ ] ??      Mel reported ESD events at Dayton causing SM1000 to crash.
		"Gerry and I did notice one thing... the SM1000 appears to be a little
                sensitive to ESD events caused by "walking across the carpet in tennis
                shoes in the booth and then touching the SM1000."  It would stop
                working and require toggling power, however it always came back
                working ok."

	*****	Looking for 0402 or 0603 TVS with 5VDC holding voltage. RGB
		Need definition of where to put these. RGB

	*****	Is action rqd here?  Anything we can do?

21  [X]         From Mel: DNL LED5 and LED8 to save a little power.
			DNL LED8	RGB
			DNL R33
			DNL LED5
			DNL R17

22  [X]         From Mel: Is R42 wired backwards? Higher output CCW vs CW?
			Mirrored part, corrected problem. RGB

23  [X]         From Mel: Silk screen pin numbers on.  Can e make CN12 larger for older Hams?
			Added pin nos for 1,8,9,16	RGB

24  [ ]         From Mel: green led too bright, increase R15 to 1500 ohms
	*****	WE should try this on all LEDs and evaluate. RGB

25  [ ]         From Mel: different colour case options

26  [ ]         From Mel: PTT being pulsed low on power up.

27 [ ]          From Peter VK5APR, DC input connector hole offset down wrt to
                enclosure on his unit.  Is this true on any other
                samples, or maybe a 1 off?  RJ45 aperture in enclosure
                also slightly offset to left.

28  [ ] firmware   Check analog speech level in digital mode.
