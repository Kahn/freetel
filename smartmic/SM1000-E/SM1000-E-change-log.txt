1.  [X]	Change PTT sw. to e-switch LC2259OANP.

2.  [X]	Change POWER SW to e-switch LC2259EENP.
	
3.  [X]	Change SPKR CONN J4 to CONN-BOOM-XH-2A.

4.  [ ]	Added part outlines to layer tDocu for documentation.

   	In progress, adding to outlines in time.

5.  [ ]	Problem with SPKR OUT conn. Shorts output when stereo jack used.
        + as per Josh Mesaline email, suggest resistors to tip and ring
          so a short doesn't upset amp.  Does this mean it will work with
          mono and stereo plugs?  If stereo only we should note this in UG.

6.  [ ]	TrimPOT holes, location off by 1mm.

7.  [X]	U1, CPU pins extend to the end of the pads.

		Corrected RGB

8.  [X]	Lad pattern for LEDs too large. I will look into this. RGB

		No action todate.

9.  [X]	SW5 land pattern too wide. Check specification.

		Corrected footprint RGB

10. [X]	C32, C59 footprint too short.

		corrected  RGB

11. [X]	L1 Land pattern too wide.

		Corrected RGB

12  [ ]	CN4	Bubble after SMT(high temperature)

		No action yet. Edwin, can you find an alternative to fit? If different footprint, let me know and send specification so
		I can change it.(RGB)

13. [X]	R46	Easy to break R46 with handling.

		Add cement after production.

14. [ ]	PCB	Problem reflowing CN10 USB connector.
		
		Make Breakaway 10mm (Edwin)

15  [ ]	PCB	Stencil too small.
		
		MAke Stencil 52 x 52 cm(Edwin)
	
16  [ ] Firmware   Better debouncing software for push button switches (DR)	

17  [ ] Enclosure  Move "Speaker Volume" text lower to clear volume control knob

18  [ ] Enclosure  Some variablility in gap between lid and front panel, gap is
                   sometimes wider on one side than another (Edwin)
19  [ ] PCB        change power led from red to green, clip/error led from amber to red?
