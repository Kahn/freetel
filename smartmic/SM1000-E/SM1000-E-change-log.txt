1.  [X]	R	Change PTT sw. to e-switch LC2259OANP.

2.  [X]	R	Change POWER SW to e-switch LC2259EENP.
	
3.  [X]	R+E	Change SPKR CONN J4 to CONN-BOOM-XH-2A.
	*****	Edwin needs to add mating connector to speaker assembly.

4.  [X]	R	Added part outlines to layer tDocu for documentation.
		All pars have outline on tplace layer.

5.  [X]	R	Problem with SPKR OUT conn. Shorts output when stereo jack used.
		+ as per Josh Mesaline email, suggest resistors to tip and ring
		so a short doesn't upset amp.  Does this mean it will work with
		mono and stereo plugs?  If stereo only we should note this in UG.
	*****	Add jmpr to ring terminal to provide ormally open circuit. Shunt must be
		provided but only on 1 pin. Customer will place across both jmpr pins for 
		use with stereo speaker/headphones.

6.  [ ]	R	TrimPOT holes, location off by 1mm.

7.  [X]	R	U1, CPU pins extend to the end of the pads.
				Corrected RGB

8.  [ ]	R+E	Land pattern for LEDs too large. I will look into this. RGB
	*****	Land pattern size recommended by vendor. If too large, need suggested pad size from Edwin.

9.  [X]	R	SW5 land pattern too wide. Check specification.
				Corrected package RGB

10. [X]	R	C32, C59 footprint too short.
		corrected package  RGB

11. [X]	R	L1 Land pattern too wide.
		Corrected package  RGB

12  [X]	R+E	CN4 Bubble after SMT(high temperature)
		No action yet. Edwin, can you find an alternative to fit? If different footprint, let me know and send specification so
		Edwin reports other vendors parts do same. Action? RGB
	*****	No Action at this time

13. [X]	E	R46 Easy to break R46 with handling.
		Add cement after production.
	*****	Note, I accidently hit and moved pot removing PCB from case. 
		Suggest applying cement prior to soldering RGB

14. [X]	E	PCB Problem reflowing CN10 USB connector.
		Make Breakaway 10mm (Edwin)
	*****	Vendor problem. RGB

15  [X]	E	PCB Stencil too small.
		Make Stencil 52 x 52 cm(Edwin)
	*****	Vendor problem. RGB
	
16  [ ] D	Firmware   Better debouncing software for push button switches (DR)	
		could be: more solid indication of in DV mode, like two beeps, two flashes

17  [ ] R	Enclosure  Move "Speaker Volume" text lower to clear volume control knob

18  [ ] E	Enclosure  Some variablility in gap between lid and front panel, gap is
                sometimes wider on one side than another (Edwin)

19  [X] R	PCB change power led from red to green, clip/error led from amber to red? 
		LED1	GRN, LED2	RED, LED3	GRN, LED4	RED
	*****	DO we need new LED packages?

20  [ ] R+D  	Mel reported ESD events at Dayton causing SM1000 to crash.
		"Gerry and I did notice one thing... the SM1000 appears to be a little
            	sensitive to ESD events caused by "walking across the carpet in tennis
            	shoes in the booth and then touching the SM1000."  It would stop
            	working and require toggling power, however it always came back
            	working ok."
	*****	Will add pads for TVS device across DC power connector & 6 X 3.5mm connectors.
		DNL status TBD. RGB	

21  [X] R    	Mel: DNL LED5 and LED8 to save a little power.
	*****	DNL LED8, DNL R33, DNL LED5, DNL R17

22  [X] R    	Mel: Is R42 wired backwards? Higher output CCW vs CW?
		Mirrored part, corrected problem. RGB

23  [X] R   	Mel: Silk screen pin numbers on.  Can e make CN12 larger for older Hams?
	*****	Added pin nos for 1,8,9,16	RGB

24  [ ]  D+E   	Mel: green led too bright, increase R15 to 1500 ohms
	*****	WE should try this on all LEDs and evaluate. RGB

25  [ ] NA    	Mel: different colour case options

26  [ ] D    	Mel: PTT being pulsed low on power up.

27  [X] R+D    	Peter VK5APR, DC input connector hole offset down wrt to
            	enclosure on his unit.  Is this true on any other
            	samples, or maybe a 1 off?  RJ45 aperture in enclosure
            	also slightly offset to left.			
	*****	RJ45 and Power connectors are almost perfectly aligned on the units I have.
		Perhaps a problem when PCBs are assembled into case?   RGB
		No Action

28  [ ] D	firmware   Check analog speech level in digital mode.

29. [ ]	R	Change enclosure side plate for new PTT switch siize & location.

30  [ ]	R	Add shunt for #5 above to BOM

31  [ ]	R	Add TVS diodes to 3,5mm connectors & DC power Connector

06/26/2015   RGB

32  [X] R	Fix problems with CN8 and Mono plug problems.
		Changed J2 & J4 connections to work with stereo or mono plugs and protect U8.

33  [X] R	Change drill & pad diameter od pad 7 of switch LC-2259 to 1.6mm & 2.54mm respectively to accomodate switch with larger tabs.
		Library & .brd updated. RGB


Rev F Ideas
-----------

[ ] jumper with series R for mic gain
[ ] consider combining grounds on patch panel as they usually are
[ ] do all gain pots increase gain when turned CW
    [ ] mic gain is wront way around
[ ] increasing arrow on trimmer pot case overlay showing increase direction
[ ] http://rfhead.net/?p=582
    [ ] larger patch panel?
    [ ] 0805 R48 gain resistors?
