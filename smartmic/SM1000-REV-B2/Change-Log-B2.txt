Changes 07/15/2014


1.  [X] SW3 holes not big enough.
		Hole is .5mm. Pin is .6mm. Hole should be 1.0mm per spec sheet. Will change. 
		07/08/2014 - RGB

2.  [X] Is C26 rated at 25V in BOM? 
		C26 is 25V in schematic, 16V in BOM. 
		OOPS! C23, C26, C40 & C46 should all be 25V. Will change database & BOM.  Murata # GRM188R71E104KA01D, Digikey # 490-1524-1-ND, Part Def: CAP CER 0.1UF 25V 10% X7R 0603
		07/08/2014 - RGB
		
3.  [X] LED8 takes up whole of pads so diff to solder 
		Corrected package for LED-LTST - LED5 & LED8.
		07/09/2014 - RGB

4.  [ ] Is CN3 a standard size?  My DC plugs don't fit in it 	
		2.5mm ID, 5.5mm OD Plug. CONN PWR PLUG DC 2.5X5.5 8A MOD Digikey # 
		CP3-002BH-ND 
		This is probably most common size in USA. Change? 

5.  [ ] couldn't solder bottom pad of U5 by hand      + hope it's OK 
		Attached to large gnd plane. Hard to solder. Designed for IR SMT 
		assembly. Try large iron on vias from bottom. 

6.  [ ] Can R6,R2,R5,R3,R4 be 10k to match R1? 
		Don't know if 10K will work for R6. Discovery has 680 or small value. 
		Try it. Can't hurt. 
		R2 & R5 Are I2C pins. Recommended 4.7K for max speed. Not used now on 
		SM1000. 10K would limit speed if used. Try it. 
		R3 & R4 should work with 10K. 
		Let me know results & I can change values if appropriate. 

7.  [X] Would VDDA power supply circuit be better located closer to U1? 
		Data sheet advises placing caps on opposite side of board, under VDDA pins. 
		Parts are place as close as possible, on same side of board. Return is low impedance plane and supply well bypassed. Unless this presents problems, I'd leave it. RGB 07/15/2014

8.  [X] Larger TAPR/Credits text on bottom?      + there is plenty of room 
		Enlarged text from 1mm to 1.42mm. Text now extends almost all the way across PCB. RGB 07/15/2014

9.  [X] What was Vin range meant to be? 
		VIN is 1 diode drop lower than VEXT(6-16VDC) or approx 5.5 - 15.5VDC Used to power LM386 to get more output swing.

10. [X] move R20 label close to R20     + I loaded R20 in the wrong place! 
		R20 designation moved adjacent to part. RGB 07/15/2014
		
11. [X] is 4k7 missing from BOM or just my order?    + I didn't have any in my Digikey order 
		Part definition error. Part # in part definition field. Will correct database & BOM.
		This affects R2,R3, R4, R5 & R48. Should be Vishay Dale # CRCW06034K70FKEA, Digikey # 541-4.70KHCT-ND, Part Def: RES 4.70K OHM 1/10W 1% 0603 SMD  07/08/2014 - RGB

12. [X] Re C26, could u pls align the BOM and sch?  I'm not sure which one has to change. 
		C26 should be 25V to accommodate +16V power in max. 
		OOPS! Found that C23, C26, C40 & C46 all should be 25V. That's why I made them separate line item. I'll Change BOM to Digikey part # 490-1524-6-ND Murata # GRM188R71E104KA01D
		07/08/2014 - Same as #2 above - RGB
		
13. [ ] Re CN3, Hmm, now I'm not sure!  I dug around in the shed and found a connector that fits so I'm OK for now. 
		CN3 is Switchcraft RASM712PX   2.5mm ID, 5.5mm OD Plug.  CONN PWR PLUG DC 2.5X5.5 8A MOD Digikey  # CP3-002BH-ND
		I've noted a problem, but will wait til you decide. RGB

14. [ ] OK I just check the BOM I have, and there are no 4.7k resistors on it, e.g. R2, R3, R4, R5.  Oh OK, the BOM has a part number.  Not sure what that mapped to on my Digikey order, just noticed I didn't get any 4k7s.  Maybe change the BOM to indicate the part value? 
		Part database  error, invalid part definition. Digikey & Vishay Dale part numbers are correct. Part definition for R2, R3, R4, R5 & R48 should be: RES 4.70K OHM 1/10W 1% 0603 SMD Will correct part database & BOM.

15. [X] CN7 3.5mm socket etc have two small plastic mounting lugs that require holes
		CN7, CN8, CN9 & CN10 plastic tabs interfere with pads on top layer. Since the tabs are plastic and don't extend thru the PCB, I am approving these 4 discrepancies. RGB 07/15.2014		

16. [X] Should R46 be described as a trimmer resistor (rather than POT?) on the BOM
		R46 incorrectly specified on BOM. Corrected. Part s described as POT in DIGIKEY description. RGB 07/15/2014

17. [X] Is label for R1 & R2 transposed? 
		Labels were transposed. Corrected. RGB 07/15/2014

18. [ ] Add 100nF reset cap as per data sheet and discovery

19. [X] replace J7 & J2 with 0805 0 ohm Rs
		 Jumpers were originally inserted to permit bringing up SM1000 and protecting circuitry from overvoltages and measuring currents. 
		 Jumpers replaced with 0 OHM resistors. RGB 07/15/2014
		 
20. [X] Added item numbers to this file to facilitate communication. RGB 07/15/2014
