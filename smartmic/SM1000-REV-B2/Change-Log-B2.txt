====================================

[X] SW3 holes not big enough.
		Hole is .5mm. Pin is .6mm. Hole should be 1.0mm per spec sheet. Will change. 
		07/08/2014 - RGB

[X] Is C26 rated at 25V in BOM? 
		C26 is 25V in schematic, 16V in BOM. 
		OOPS! C23, C26, C40 & C46 should all be 25V. Will change database & BOM.  Murata # GRM188R71E104KA01D, Digikey # 490-1524-1-ND, Part Def: CAP CER 0.1UF 25V 10% X7R 0603
		07/08/2014 - RGB
		
[X] LED8 takes up whole of pads so diff to solder 
		Corrected package for LED-LTST - LED5 & LED8.
		07/09/2014 - RGB

[ ] Is CN3 a standard size?  My DC plugs don't fit in it 	
		2.5mm ID, 5.5mm OD Plug. CONN PWR PLUG DC 2.5X5.5 8A MOD Digikey # 
		CP3-002BH-ND 
		This is probably most common size in USA. Change? 

[ ] couldn't solder bottom pad of U5 by hand      + hope it's OK 
		Attached to large gnd plane. Hard to solder. Designed for IR SMT 
		assembly. Try large iron on vias from bottom. 

[ ] Can R6,R2,R5,R3,R4 be 10k to match R1? 
		Don't know if 10K will work for R6. Discovery has 680 or small value. 
		Try it. Can't hurt. 
		R2 & R5 Are I2C pins. Recommended 4.7K for max speed. Not used now on 
		SM1000. 10K would limit speed if used. Try it. 
		R3 & R4 should work with 10K. 
		Let me know results & I can change values if appropriate. 

[ ] Would VDDA power supply circuit be better located closer to U1? 
		I think they are pretty close now. I'll look at VDDA function and advise. 

[ ] Larger TAPR/Credits text on bottom?      + there is plenty of room 
		Tried to get printing without visa & pads in the text. Smallest via has 
		.016" drill and is tented. I'll enlarge text & see what I can do. 

[ ] What was Vin range meant to be? 
		VIN is 1 diode drop lower than VEXT(6-16VDC) or approx 5.5 - 15.5VDC Used to power LM386 to get more output swing.

[ ] move R20 label close to R20     + I loaded R20 in the wrong place! 
		Will do. 

[X] is 4k7 missing from BOM or just my order?    + I didn't have any in my Digikey order 
		Part definition error. Part # in part definition field. Will correct database & BOM.
		This affects R2,R3, R4, R5 & R48. Should be Vishay Dale # CRCW06034K70FKEA, Digikey # 541-4.70KHCT-ND, Part Def: RES 4.70K OHM 1/10W 1% 0603 SMD
		07/08/2014 - RGB

[X] Re C26, could u pls align the BOM and sch?  I'm not sure which one has to change. 
		C26 should be 25V to accommodate +16V power in max. 
		OOPS! Found that C23, C26, C40 & C46 all should be 25V. That's why I made them separate line item. I'll Change BOM to Digikey part # 490-1524-6-ND Murata # GRM188R71E104KA01D
		07/08/2014 - Same as #2 above - RGB
		
[ ] Re CN3, Hmm, now I'm not sure!  I dug around in the shed and found a connector that fits so I'm OK for now. 
		CN3 is Switchcraft RASM712PX   2.5mm ID, 5.5mm OD Plug.  CONN PWR PLUG DC 2.5X5.5 8A MOD Digikey  # CP3-002BH-ND
		I've noted a problem, but will wait til you decide.

[ ] OK I just check the BOM I have, and there are no 4.7k resistors on it, e.g. R2, R3, R4, R5.  Oh OK, the BOM has a part number.  Not sure what that mapped to on my Digikey order, just noticed I didn't get any 4k7s.  Maybe change the BOM to indicate the part value? 
		Part database  error, invalid part definition. Digikey & Vishay Dale part numbers are correct. Part definition for R2, R3, R4, R5 & R48 should be: RES 4.70K OHM 1/10W 1% 0603 SMD Will correct part database & BOM.

====================================

[ ] CN7 3.5mm socket etc have two small plastic mounting lugs that require holes
[ ] Could C40 be rated at 16V?
[ ] Should R46 be described as a trimmer resistor (rather than POT?) on the BOM
[ ] Is label for R1 & R2 transposed?
[ ] Add 100nF reset cap as per data sheet and discovery
[ ] replace J7 & J2 with 0805 0 ohm Rs
