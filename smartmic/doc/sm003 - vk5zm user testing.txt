Testing SM1000 OTA at Matt's House 28 Jan 2015
----------------------------------------------

  + First SM1000 OTA SM1000 QSO between VK5AKH (Andy) and VK5ZM (Matt) at 
    Matt's QTH.  Matt connected the SM1000 to his IC706. 2130 SA time

  0. Connected up patch panel, used rig mic, ptt, rig spkr through RJ45.
     spkr and ptt had common ground which required and extra grnd jumper.
     Matt " for fat fingers rather fiddly".  Would be good to doucment this
     for common radios.
  1. While monitoring with FT817 found similar slope on spectrum/scatter 
     diagram to IC7200
      + HF modem tones around 2000 Hz attenutaed by several dB
      + get to the bottom of tx slope, say with test signal
  2.  Andy sounded a bit distorted on rx
      + Backed off his mic level and was better
  3. Matt lugged in a Heil headset, had to reduce mic gain, clipping led
     was very useful.  No noise issues.  Mic gain trimmer was a little too
     sensitive.  Suggest multiturn trimmer.
  4. Analog mode works OK once mic gain adjusted.  Tip: do mic level adj
     in analog mode, then dig should be OK.  
  5. Switching an to dig worked OK, levels OK.
  6. AF gain of IC720 was slaved to the AF out in RJ45.  So trap is turning
     down AF gain stopped FreeDV, turning up led to clipping.
  7. Secondary use is analog processing.  Move sliders to adf filters, 
     look at audio spectra with white noise or chirp, monitor on 2nd radio.
