Changes 07/22/2014 Reformatted file to fit on Schematic.


1.  [X] SW3 holes not big enough.
		Hole is .5mm. Pin is .6mm. Hole should be 1.0mm per spec sheet. Will change. 
		07/08/2014 - RGB

2.  [X] Is C26 rated at 25V in BOM? 
		C26 is 25V in schematic, 16V in BOM. 
		OOPS! C23, C26, C40 & C46 should all be 25V. Will change database & BOM.  
		Murata # GRM188R71E104KA01D, Digikey # 490-1524-1-ND, Part Def: CAP CER 0.1UF 25V 10% X7R 0603
		07/08/2014 - RGB
		
3.  [X] LED8 takes up whole of pads so diff to solder 
		Corrected package for LED-LTST - LED5 & LED8.
		07/09/2014 - RGB

4.  [X] Is CN3 a standard size?  My DC plugs don't fit in it 	
		2.5mm ID, 5.5mm OD Plug. CONN PWR PLUG DC 2.5X5.5 8A MOD Digikey # 
		CP3-002BH-ND 
		This is probably most common size in USA. Same size as Raspberry PI, BeagleBone, 
		SignaLink & others. RGB 07/15/2014

5.  [X] couldn't solder bottom pad of U5 by hand      + hope it's OK 
		Attached to large gnd plane. Hard to solder. Designed for IR SMT 
		assembly. Try large iron on vias from bottom. 
		Part will solder in production. RGB 07/15/2014

6.  [ ] Can R6,R2,R5,R3,R4 be 10k to match R1? 
		Don't know if 10K will work for R6. Discovery has 680 or small value. 
		Try it. Can't hurt. 
		R2 & R5 Are I2C pins. Recommended 4.7K for max speed. Not used now on 
		SM1000. 10K would limit speed if used. Try it. 
		R3 & R4 should work with 10K. 
		Let me know results & I can change values if appropriate. 

7.  [X] Would VDDA power supply circuit be better located closer to U1? 
		Data sheet advises placing caps on opposite side of board, under VDDA pins. 
		Parts are place as close as possible, on same side of board. Return is low 
		impedance plane and supply well bypassed. Unless this presents problems, 
		I'd leave it. RGB 07/15/2014

8.  [X] Larger TAPR/Credits text on bottom?      + there is plenty of room 
		Enlarged text from 1mm to 1.42mm. Text now extends almost all the way 
		across PCB. RGB 07/15/2014

9.  [X] What was Vin range meant to be? 
		VIN is 1 diode drop lower than VEXT(6-16VDC) or approx 5.5 - 15.5VDC 
		Used to power LM386 to get more output swing.

10. [X] move R20 label close to R20     + I loaded R20 in the wrong place! 
		R20 designation moved adjacent to part. RGB 07/15/2014
		
11. [X] is 4k7 missing from BOM or just my order?    + I didn't have any in my Digikey order 
		Part definition error. Part # in part definition field. Will correct database & BOM.
		This affects R2,R3, R4, R5 & R48. Should be Vishay Dale # CRCW06034K70FKEA, 
		Digikey # 541-4.70KHCT-ND, Part Def: RES 4.70K OHM 1/10W 1% 0603 SMD  
		07/08/2014 - RGB

12. [X] Re C26, could u pls align the BOM and sch?  I'm not sure which one has to change. 
		C26 should be 25V to accommodate +16V power in max. 
		OOPS! Found that C23, C26, C40 & C46 all should be 25V. That's why I made them 
		separate line item. I'll Change BOM to Digikey part # 490-1524-6-ND 
		Murata # GRM188R71E104KA01D
		07/08/2014 - Same as #2 above - RGB
		
13. [ ] Re CN3, Hmm, now I'm not sure!  I dug around in the shed and found a connector 
		that fits so I'm OK for now. CN3 is Switchcraft RASM712PX   2.5mm ID, 5.5mm OD Plug.
		CONN PWR PLUG DC 2.5X5.5 8A MOD Digikey  # CP3-002BH-ND
		I've noted a problem, but will wait til you decide. RGB

14. [X] OK I just check the BOM I have, and there are no 4.7k resistors on it, e.g. 
		R2, R3, R4, R5.  
		Part database  error, invalid part definition. Digikey & Vishay Dale part 
		numbers are correct. Part definition for R2, R3, R4, R5 & R48 should be: 
		RES 4.70K OHM 1/10W 1% 0603 SMD Will correct part database & BOM.
		R2, R3, R4, R5 & R48 now 4.70K 1/10W 1% 0603 parts in B2 revision. RGB 07/15/2014

15. [X] CN7 3.5mm socket etc have two small plastic mounting lugs that require holes
		CN7, CN8, CN9 & CN10 plastic tabs interfere with pads on top layer. Since the 
		tabs are plastic and don't extend thru the PCB, I am approving these 4 discrepancies. 
		RGB 07/15.2014		

16. [X] Should R46 be described as a trimmer resistor (rather than POT?) on the BOM
		R46 incorrectly specified on BOM. Corrected. Part s described as POT in DIGIKEY 
		description. RGB 07/15/2014

17. [X] Is label for R1 & R2 transposed? 
		Labels were transposed. Corrected. RGB 07/15/2014

18. [X] Add 100nF reset cap as per data sheet and discovery
		Added C48, 100nF cap across J5 to implement power up reset function. RGB 07/17/2014

19. [X] replace J7 & J2 with 0805 0 ohm Rs
		 Jumpers were originally inserted to permit bringing up SM1000 and protecting 
		 circuitry from overvoltages and measuring currents. 
		 Jumpers replaced with 0 OHM resistors. RGB 07/15/2014
		 
20. [X] Added item numbers to this file to facilitate communication. RGB 07/15/2014

Latest change notes David 14 August

21. [X] R46 to 100k
		[ ] add series R to prevent DAC distortion?
		[ ] get to bottom on LM386 distortion?
		Added RGB
22. [X] Add 22k betwwen DAC2 and ground
		+ making R46 100k lead to some analog coupling between ADC2 and DAC2,
		not qute sure why, this lowers Z of this net
		Added RGB
23. [X] R52 1k trimmer wasn't on my digikey order
		+ probably my mistake, but check BOM
		Is in BOM RGB
[ ] C36 is along way away from U6
    + poss to move closer?
[ ] Mic DC bias v low, about 0.3V
    + should we change R39?
[ ] Idea - clear labels next to each trimmers in large font
    + and connectors and TP, hard to see with naked eye
[ ] foot print for a small reset button
    + I press it a lot, gd for experimenting
[ ] 1nF to filter noise across 500k R42 but very close to op-amp
[ ] highly senstive net between R53 and R42 should be shorter if possible, 
    as we are getting a lot of noise pick up.
[ ] Move ADC power supply bypass network v close to pins 21/22 U1B and
    away from switcher + as per Discovery board
[ ] route op-amp bypass caps directly to op amp power supply pins on same layer, place nearby

[ ] Idea - clear labels next to each trimmers in large font
    + and connectors
[ ] foot print for a small reset button
    + I press it a lot, gd for experimenting

[ ] Matt - PCB review + manufacture

[ ] Modem appears to be losing sync on time slips
    + investigate this in simulation form
[ ] check trimmers all go the same way around
[ ] connect C36 to + term of U6, delete R43
[ ] some gain on U6 a good idea?
    + laptop audio ouput just a few 100mVpp
    + at least put in resistors.
[ ] very big robust pads for R46
    + pot keeps falling off, breaking pads
[ ] Consider case made from PCB, like sniffers
    + can get all holes drilled
    + gd RF shielding
[ ] should square pad on Mic be gnd side?
[ ] added 3n9 between U8 p3 and ground 
    + removed some tonal noise and 
[ ] changed R39 to 2k2
    + mic bias now 2.8V
[ ] Switcher noise reduction idea
    + is there away to lock the switcher osc to a uC clock?
    + we could make it a multiple of ADC/DAC sample rate
    + thus aliasing all noise down to 0 Hz
    + need swicther to freerun until uC starts
[ ] review jumpers and see if it makes mores sense to make them 0 ohm 0805s
[ ] C24 closer to U1?
[ ] C40 should be 47nF
    + David used wrong value on prototype
[ ] LD2 opto-isolator footprint wrong (or maybe I ordered wrong part) 
[ ] location of C51 net label
[ ] SW1 needs bigger pads to make hand solderable
    + is this suitable as a PTT switch?
    + button is quite small
    + locking PTT as per SW3 useful for testing (want to leave tx on)
[ ] CN12 is hard to solder manually, need larger mechanical pads
    + although this would increase the outline so maybe not a problem
[ ] CN2 difficult to hand solder, extend padds back towards outline
