Changes 07/22/2014 Reformatted file to fit on Schematic.
Reformatted file to include Status: and status indicator.	RGB 09/15/14
Status:	[ O] OPEN - no action taken,  	[X] Complete, Schematic changes made, no further action. Physical layout changes will be made as PCB is re-routed.
============================================================================================================================================

1.  [X] SW3 holes not big enough.
		Hole is .5mm. Pin is .6mm. Hole should be 1.0mm per spec sheet.
	Status:	Complete - Drill size changed to 1.0mm  9/1/14 RGB

2.  [X] Is C26 rated at 25V in BOM? 
		C26 is 25V in schematic, 16V in BOM. 
		OOPS! C23, C26, C40 & C46 should all be 25V. Will change database & BOM.  
		Murata # GRM188R71E104KA01D, Digikey # 490-1524-1-ND, Part Def: CAP CER 0.1UF 25V 10% X7R 0603
	Status: Complete - reflected in SM1000-C BOM	09/15/14 - RGB
		
3.  [X] LED8 takes up whole of pads so diff to solder 
		Corrected package for LED-LTST - LED5 & LED8.
	Status:	Complete - new package in SM1000-C artwork.	09/15/14 - RGB

4.  [X] Is CN3 a standard size?  My DC plugs don't fit in it 	
		2.5mm ID, 5.5mm OD Plug. CONN PWR PLUG DC 2.5X5.5 8A MOD Digikey # 
		CP3-002BH-ND 
		Determined 2.1mm x 5.5mm most common size. 
	Status:	Complete - Changed CN3 to RASM722PX to accomodate 2.1mm x 5.5mm plug. In SM1000-C artwork.  RGB 09/14/14

5.  [X] couldn't solder bottom pad of U5 by hand      + hope it's OK 
		Attached to large gnd plane. Hard to solder. Designed for IR SMT 
		assembly. Try large iron on vias from bottom. 
	Status:	No Change. Part will solder in production. RGB 09/15/14

6.  [O] Can R6,R2,R5,R3,R4 be 10k to match R1? 
		Don't know if 10K will work for R6. Discovery has 680 or small value. 
		Try it. Can't hurt. 
		R2 & R5 Are I2C pins. Spec 4.7K
		R3 & R4 should work with 10K. 
	Status:	No change - See above. Let me know results & I can change values if appropriate. RGB 09/15/14

7.  [O] Would VDDA power supply circuit be better located closer to U1? 
		Data sheet advises placing caps on opposite side of board, under VDDA pins. 
		Parts are place as close as possible, on same side of board. Return is low 
		impedance plane and supply well bypassed. Unless this presents problems, 
	Status:	Will relocate parts on PCB. RGB 07/15/2014

8.  [X] Larger TAPR/Credits text on bottom?      + there is plenty of room 
		Enlarged text from 1mm to 1.42mm. Text now extends almost all the way 
		across PCB. 
	Status:	Complete. RGB 07/15/2014

9.  [X] What was Vin range meant to be? 
		VIN is 1 diode drop lower than VEXT(6-16VDC) or approx 5.5 - 15.5VDC 
		Used to power LM386 to get more output swing.
	Status:	cHANGED TO 2.1MM X 5.5MM - RGB 09/15/14

10. [X] move R20 label close to R20     + I loaded R20 in the wrong place! 
		R20 designation moved adjacent to part.
	Status:	Done - RGB	07/15/14
		
11. [X] is 4k7 missing from BOM or just my order?    + I didn't have any in my Digikey order 
		Part definition error. Part # in part definition field. Will correct database & BOM.
		This affects R2,R3, R4, R5 & R48. Should be Vishay Dale # CRCW06034K70FKEA, 
		Digikey # 541-4.70KHCT-ND, Part Def: RES 4.70K OHM 1/10W 1% 0603 SMD  
	Status:	Complete	07/08/2014 - RGB

12. [X] Re C26, could u pls align the BOM and sch?  I'm not sure which one has to change. 
		C26 should be 25V to accommodate +16V power in max. 
		OOPS! Found that C23, C26, C40 & C46 all should be 25V. That's why I made them 
		separate line item. I'll Change BOM to Digikey part # 490-1524-6-ND 
		Murata # GRM188R71E104KA01D
	Status:	Complete - Same as #2 above - 07/08/2014	RGB
		
13. [X] Re CN3, Hmm, now I'm not sure!  I dug around in the shed and found a connector 
		that fits so I'm OK for now. CN3 is Switchcraft RASM712PX   2.5mm ID, 5.5mm OD Plug.
		CONN PWR PLUG DC 2.5X5.5 8A MOD Digikey  # CP3-002BH-ND
		I've noted a problem, but will wait til you decide. RGB
		Same as #4. Replaced with RASM722PX.
	Status:	Complete	  RGB 09/14/14
	
14. [X] OK I just check the BOM I have, and there are no 4.7k resistors on it, e.g. 
		R2, R3, R4, R5.  
		Part database  error, invalid part definition. Digikey & Vishay Dale part 
		numbers are correct. Part definition for R2, R3, R4, R5 & R48 should be: 
		RES 4.70K OHM 1/10W 1% 0603 SMD Will correct part database & BOM.
		R2, R3, R4, R5 & R48 now 4.70K 1/10W 1% 0603 parts in B2 revision.
	Status:	Complete	 RGB 07/15/2014
	
15. [X] CN7 3.5mm socket etc have two small plastic mounting lugs that require holes
		CN7, CN8, CN9 & CN10 plastic tabs interfere with pads on top layer. Since the 
		tabs are plastic and don't extend thru the PCB, I am approving these 4 discrepancies. 	
	Status:	Complete	RGB 07/15.2014	
	
16. [X] Should R46 be described as a trimmer resistor (rather than POT?) on the BOM
		R46 incorrectly specified on BOM. Corrected. Part s described as POT in DIGIKEY 
		description. 
	Status:	POT	RGB 07/15/2014
	
17. [X] Is label for R1 & R2 transposed? 
		Labels were transposed. Corrected. 
	Status:	Complete - RGB 07/15/2014
	
18. [X] Add 100nF reset cap as per data sheet and discovery
		Added C48, 100nF cap across J5 to implement power up reset function. 
	Status - Added to schematic & BOM, will implement on PCB	RGB 07/17/2014
	
19. [X] replace J7 & J2 with 0805 0 ohm Rs
		 Jumpers were originally inserted to permit bringing up SM1000 and protecting 
		 circuitry from overvoltages and measuring currents. 
		 Jumpers replaced with 0 OHM resistors. R18 & R21. 
	Status:	Schematic & BOM changed, Will implement on PCB	 RGB 09/9/2014
	
20. [X] Added item numbers to this file to facilitate communication. RGB 07/15/2014

========= Latest change notes David 14 August ==========

		[ ] get to bottom on LM386 distortion?
	Status:	Added to schematic & BOM. Will place on PCB RGB 09/15/14
	
22. [X] Add 22k between DAC2 and ground
		+ making R46 100k lead to some analog coupling between ADC2 and DAC2,
		not qute sure why, this lowers Z of this net
	Status:	Added to schematic & BOM. Will place on PCB RGB 09/15/14
		
23. [X] R52 1k trimmer wasn't on my digikey order
		+ probably my mistake, but check BOM
		Is in BOM 
	Status:	No Action	RGB 9/8/14
	
24.	[X] C36 is along way away from U6
    + poss to move closer?	
  Status:	 Cap moved to staging area. Will be moved closer during re-layout. RGB 9/8/14
  
25.	[X] Mic DC bias v low, about 0.3V
    + should we change R39?
	Data sheet calls for 2.2K, not 22.1K. Changed schematic & BOM. 
	Status:	Complete - Changed on schematic & BOM No PCB action necessary.	RGB 9/8/14
    
26.	[X] Idea - clear labels next to each trimmers in large font
    + and connectors and TP, hard to see with naked eye
	Status:	ENLARGED TO 1.016MM. RGB 9/8/14
    
27.	[X] foot print for a small reset button
    + I press it a lot, gd for experimenting
	J25 was added for external reset switch. Do you still want on board sw?
    Status: HEADER PROVIDED RGB 09/15/14
    
28.	[X] 1nF to filter noise across 500k R42 but very close to op-amp.
	Status: Added. Correct placement? RGB 9/8/14.

29.	[O] highly senstive net between R53 and R42 should be shorter if possible, 
    as we are getting a lot of noise pick up.
	Did #28 fix problem? Could reposition op-amp circuit components during re-layout.
   Status: No action taken yet.   RGB 9/8/14
   
30.	[O] Move ADC power supply bypass network v close to pins 21/22 U1B and
    away from switcher + as per Discovery board
    Status: PArts will be repositioned during re-layout. RGB 09/15/14
    
31.	[O] route op-amp bypass caps directly to op amp power supply pins on same layer, place nearby
	Good idea. Will do in re-layout.
	Status:	will reposition during re-layout RGB 09/15/14
	
32.	[X] Idea - clear labels next to each trimmers in large font
    + and connectors
	Status:	Same as #26 RGB 09/15/14
	
================================================================
renumber to correct for duplicate #31 RGB 9/8/14

33.	[] foot print for a small reset button
    + I press it a lot, gd for experimenting
	Status:	No Action Taken - Duplicate of #27  RGB 9/8/14

34.	[ ] Matt - PCB review + manufacture
	Status:	No Action Taken RGB  09/15/14

    + investigate this in simulation form
	Status: Not duplicated. No Action Taken	RGB 09/15/14
    
36.	[X] check trimmers all go the same way around
	Changed R42 & R47 to operate in same direction as other pots. 
	Status: Schematic & BOM changed. Will update artwork during re-layout.	RGB 09/8/14
	
37.	[] connect C36 to + term of U6, delete R43
	Need series resistance to sum c36 into u6+?
	Contradicted by #38?
	Status:	No Action TAken	RGB 09/08/14
	
38.	[O] some gain on U6 a good idea?
    + laptop audio ouput just a few 100mVpp
    + at least put in resistors.
	Leave R43, C36 and add 10K res(R23 new) from U6-out to U6- for av=1. What gain desired?
    Status: Need gain computation. 
    
39.	[O] very big robust pads for R46
    + pot keeps falling off, breaking pads
    Status: CAn enlarge pads. no effect on schematic, BOM.	RGB 09/15/14
   
40.	[] Consider case made from PCB, like sniffers
    + can get all holes drilled
    + gd RF shielding
	Your choice. Daryl felt 3D -> metal not good solution.
	Status:	No Action TAken	RGB 09/15/14
    
41.	[X] should square pad on Mic be gnd side?
	Mic data sheet referred to term 1(amp out) and term 2 GND. That's the way I laid it out.
	I see your point though, change would aid assembly.
	Status:	Footprint changed. 

42.	[X] added 3.9nF between U8 p3 and ground 
    + removed some tonal noise and 
    Status: Added. RGB 09/26/14
    
43.	[X] changed R39 to 2k2
    + mic bias now 2.8V
	Status:	Changed. RGB 09/26/14
    
44.	[X] Switcher noise reduction idea
    + is there away to lock the switcher osc to a uC clock?
    + we could make it a multiple of ADC/DAC sample rate
    + thus aliasing all noise down to 0 Hz
    + need swicther to freerun until uC starts
		From data sheet, switcher freq determined by components. No ext sync capability. RGB 09/10/14
		For intermittent starts, look at ext PS rise ti me?
	Status: Suggested shielded inductor. RGB 09/26/14
    
45.	[O] review jumpers and see if it makes mores sense to make them 0 ohm 0805s
		If you implement self test code, then you want J1, but don't ship shunt.
		Same for Reset jumper, J5.
		J3 - there to remove bias from mic input. Need?
	Status:	need decision from David.	RGB 09/10/14

46.	[X] C24 closer to U1?
		WIll move at re-route time. 
	Status: WIll move in PCB re-layout. RGB 09/10/14
	
47.	[X] C40 should be 47nF
    + David used wrong value on prototype
		Changed to 47nF.   See Questions
    Status:	Schematic & BOM changed. NO effect on PCB.	RGB 9/10/14
    
48.	[X] LD2 opto-isolator footprint wrong (or maybe I ordered wrong part) 
		My mistake. Part is 8mm pin to pin, not 6mm.
	Status:	Corrected. RGB 09/26/14
		
49.	[X] location of C51 net label
		DOne. 
	Status: Complete RGB 9/10/14
	
50.	[O] SW1 needs bigger pads to make hand solderable
    + is this suitable as a PTT switch?
    + button is quite small
    + locking PTT as per SW3 useful for testing (want to leave tx on)
		Location of PTT sw fits hand. Current sw is small. Might be able to use another switch. Do you really want push-push? Will look at larger pads pending question resolution. RGB 9/10/14
   Status:	esearching larger switch.	RGB 09/15/14
   
51.	[X] CN12 is hard to solder manually, need larger mechanical pads
    + although this would increase the outline so maybe not a problem
	Status:	Changed  RGB 9/24/14
    
52.	[X] CN2 difficult to hand solder, extend padds back towards outline
	Status:	Extended  RGB 09/24/14

53. [X] Replace R9 with a bead
	Status: Replaced R9 with Taiyo Yuden CBC3225T101MR inductor. RGB 09/11/14
        http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/CBC3225T101MR/587-1628-1-ND/1008243
	Status: Replace with Murata BLM18PG121SN1  RGB 10/02/14
	
        DR 30 Sep 2014; Matt, VK5ZM, suggested Taiyo Yuden
        CBC3225T101MR however Glen English suggested this would give
        an inductive kick so lets use a bead for L3.  As per Matt's
        suggestion pls move C30 to junction of L3 and D2.
	
54. [X] Replace C25, C29, C28 with tants.
	Status:	Switched Ceramics to Tantalum.

55. [X] Stereo connector for CB6-CN8
    + only getting audio in one earphone when common stereo headphones used
    + should "from radio" and "to radio" connectors be stereo (wired as mono) ?
	Status:	Replaced CN6 & CN8 with 3wire stereo connector.  Will position during re-layout	RGB 09/14/14

56. [X] Remove +VEXT from schematic.
		Originally used to allow power from rig mic connector to power SM1000.
	Status:	Complete - Effects schematc only.	RGB	09/11/14
	
57. [O] Matt VK5ZM has suggested 57 x 100mm PCB
    + some sort of standard?  At least 3 manufacturers making boxes to that size
    + e.g. Eddystone, Hammond 1590
    + supply easy in US or Asutalia
    + Just a suggestion at this stage, part of the enclosure discussion
    Status:	No Action	RGB 09/15/14

58. [O]Nice tactile feeling switch for PTT
		(like power switch, put perhaps not locking?)
	Status: No Action. Will look for switch.  RGB 09/27/14

59. [X]	1nF on ADC1 and ADC2 inputs close to uC.  But DNL for now. While debgugging noise I found big spikes and ringing when the ADCs sample.  I think it's the inability of the op-amps to drive high frequencies.  These caps removed the ringing, but made no apparant difference to the noise.  However I think they are useful as a precaution to reduce the general level of noise on the board.
	Status: COmplete, marked as DNL. RGB 09/27/14
	
60. [X]	1500 resistor between ADC1 and ADC2 and outputs from op-amps.  After much experimentation these were found to reduce the static type clicks being produced by ADC to acceptable levels.
	Status: COmplete. RGB 09/27/14

61. [X]	LM386 power supply bypassing to remove switcher "washing macine" type noise from ouput audio.  4.7 ohm (rated at 200mA, IIR=0.2W) between VIN and pin 6 U8.  220uF electrolytic between pin 6 and GND.  Both placed near U8.
		Status: Completed.  RGB 10/02/14
	
62.  [X] Do we want CN9 to disable RJ45 PTT or perhaps have both in parallel?  Do all radios switch PTT to ground?  Or should both ends of LD2 be routed to CN9 and CN14? 
		You should never have cable to CN4 and CN6,CN7,& CN9.
		SignaLink cable will bring whatever is at the Rig Digital connector to the SM1000
		Status: Implemented parallel configuration  RGB 09/27/14
		
63. [O] U3 (USB chip) is hot to touch, in normal operation and USB boot mode. 
    + same chip isn't hot on Discovery
    + suspect this is a "David error" - e.g. wrong resistors loaded,
      pot is also glued to PCB nearby which may be shorting and USB
      connector has become detached once so there may be a short.
	Status: Open. Needs debug.	RGB 09/27/14
	
64.  [O] Found soldering little wires to the RJ45 patch panel unwieldy.  Is there a better way?   Also should we separate the grounds for mic/spkr/ptt to rig?  mic grounds often separate on rig connectors.
	Status: could use thru hole part,but would require hand soldering - extra mfg operation		RGB 09/27/14
	
65.  [O] While debugging noise in "analog" mode (testing between two SSB radios):
		[X] load C55 & C56, both 1nF, reduced switcher noise
		[X] add 100nF across R40, also reduced switcher noise
		[X] add 100uF 6.3V electrolytic (or tant) across R40, this reduced 50Hz frame rate noise
		[ ] Microphone bypass network:
		[X] Add 100 ohm R in net between J3/R39
        [X] Change C32 to 100uF 6.3V electrolytic (or tant) and move to junction of 100 ohm/R39 to AVSS
        [X] add 100nF across 100uF C32
		Status: A lot of new parts!

66. [X]	Change R48 to 10k, makes level adjustment on FT817 easier.  TBC on further radio testing.
	Status: Changed  RGB 09/27/14
	
67. [O]	Spacing of 3.5mm connectors.  Some interference when tested with 3.5mm
		leads.  Measured (max) diameter of several 3.5mm plugs as 11.1mm, 11.3,
		9.2, 5.8, 9.8.  Could we extend under DC power connector?  measure max DC power
                plus diameter (molded part) as 9.8, 8.5, 9.4mm
	Status: Need to talk about this.  RGB 09/27/14

68. [X]	Pls add 480 ohm series resistors in series with BOOT0, select, and back nets.
		Changed SW1 to NC. 480 Ohm not needed
		
                
======================================================================================================================================================================================
The following should be added as items to list above & numbered. Too many places to look for possible changes. Also, there should be some means of showing resolution. RGB 09/27/14

	
Questions:

1.  [X] SM1000 designed to be operated with 6-16V power supply. Would
        should recommend 9-15V. Should we recommend PS? Many will
        operate at 13.8V(rig supply). Do we risk ground loops,
        etc. using rig supply?
       
        DR 29 Sep 2014: tested with IC7200 at full power using same
        12V battery as SM1000.  No problems observed, so I think we
        are Ok for now.  Lets call this Ok for now (ie no specific rec
        for PS) and see if any problems appear with Beta units.
 
2.  [X] Should C37, C39, C40 be 50V? Or, only caps connected to VIN?
        DR 29 Sep 2014: Yes, good call.

Production Questions
--------------------

1/ [X] How do end users deal with RJ45 patch panel?  Hand solder?  DR
   29 Sep 2014: RSB has answered this with patch panel concept (female
   header and plug in wires)

2/ [ ] Do we supply a loud speaker?

3/ [ ] What enclosure do we supply?

Rev C PCB layout notes
----------------------

1/ As per app notes (e.g.  "As per June 2001 pcd mixed signal ... " PDF)

   [ ] Unbroken ground plane
   [ ] Where to split/connect power plane
   [ ] signals that cross power plane split must be on layer 
       adjacent to ground plane (see checklist in artcile above)
   [ ] Consider in layout:      
       + Audio power supply currents will flow in path of least
         resistance, so back to 3.3V regulator? (Vin for LM386).  See
         if layout means they get mixed with any digital/switcher
         currents.
       + high freq currents will follow path of least impedance
         
2/ L1, R10, C10, C12, C11, C13 close to U1 with direct connection to p20
====> Parts staged to do this when PCB routing done. RGB 09/27/14

3/ Large lables for connectors and trimmers.  Maybe single letters or
symbols so they can fit?  So user doesn't have to refer to schematic
====> Locations should be shown in "User Guide". There is a limit to component density and the number of labelling exceptions. If you want some specific labelling let me know. RGB 09/27/14
 
3/ Large labels on PCB for connectors and trimmers.  Maybe single letters or
symbols so they can fit?  So user doesn't have to refer to schematic when setting up.
====> Ditto

BOM checklist
-------------

[X] CN12 female box header and wire?
    + should we provide some male headers?  NO
    + should we approach signal-link? Don't have to. Several vendors use this scheme.
    [X] CN3 specified as RASM722PX Yes
    [O] knob for pot:	Will add to BOM

Risk List
---------

1. [X] Risk: Inductive kick from L3 damaging components on board.  
       Action: Confirm value with Matt, decide on if we should 
       downgrade to a bead. (see #53, decn made to use bead).

2. [ ] Risk: Untested changes in schematic leading to a major problem
       in 100 Beta resulting in repair.  Action: David to review all
       change log entries above to determine if any have been
       untested.

3. [ ] Risk: Software not ready when Beta hardware arrives: Action:
       DR Specify min software load (e.g. configuration menus, SNR read
       out, set up procedure)
