Test Plan for Rev C SM1000
David Rowe 15/12/14

[X] 5V and 3V3 rails OK
[X] 1.24V across C14 and C15
    + on chip regulator working
[X] Goes into USB DFU mode when PTT held down on power on/reset
    + STM32F4 BOOTLOADER device appears on Host PC USB port
    + note plug USB Cable in after power up, otherwise Host PC will
      supply power and prevent power cycle.
[X] Flash dac_ut.bin using USB on Linux:
    $ sudo apt-get install dfu-util
    $ sudo dfu-util -d 0483:df11 -c 1 -i 0 -a 0 -s 0x08000000 -D dac_ut.bin
    + if this works it will run for about 6 seconds then stop, you don't
      get a sucess message   
    + power cycle/reset 
[X] dac_ut works
    [X] several volts PP audio freq sine wave on test points P2/P3
    [X] loud sine wave from speaker or headphones

[X] 2.74V across MIC1
[X] speak into mic, or tap board, sould be a few Vpp
    + mic gain R42 roughly in the middle of travel

Useful Command Lines
--------------------

Receiving freedv waveform from SM1000 via mic input on laptop and decode to wave file:

$ cd codec2-dev/build/src
$ rec -r 8000 -s -2 -c 1 -t raw - trim 0 10 | ./freedv_rx - - | sox -t raw -r 8000 -s -2 - ~/Desktop/sm1000_beta_dv.wav

TODO
----

(need more detail, pass/fail conditions)

[ ] set up procedure to get levels right/minimise distortion on TX
[ ] unit test for buttons and leds
[ ] test device in analog mode OTA
    + two radios
[ ] test device in DV mode from modem files on a PC
[ ] test device in digital mode OTA
[ ] test patch panel 
[ ] test each connector can be reached by cables
[ ] Test PTT control of radio works
[ ] noise tests
[ ] test external mic
[ ] test external speaker/headphones
[ ] Get another experienced Ham to try it
    + watch them and refine install procedure
[ ] Speaker volume in a moving car

Software TODO

[ ] Switch sign changed
[ ] Way to insert callsign, like USB serial "monitor"
[ ] way to relate firmware to SVN rev
