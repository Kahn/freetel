1. Change labels on top overlay near trimmers
   [ ] SPKR IN -> RIG SPKR
   [ ] EXT MIC -> MIC GAIN
   [ ] Remove INT MIC label (it's not associated with a trimmer)
   
2.  [ ]  Change LED8 to LTST-S2200K. Will correct wrong footprint proble.

3.  [ ] Investigate moving USB connector forward so that it extends trhu the rear panel. 
        If it extends thru pane, we can change panel cutout back to smaller opening and not block LEDs.

4.  [ ] TS-26 switch footprint is mirrored front to back. Fix footprint.
