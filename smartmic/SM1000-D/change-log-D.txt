1. Change labels on top overlay near trimmers
   [X] SPKR IN -> RIG SPKR
   [X] EXT MIC -> MIC GAIN
   [X] Remove INT MIC label (it's not associated with a trimmer)
		INT MIC  Identifies internal microphone. Will move to remove confusion. RGB 12/30/14
   
2.  [X] Change LED8 to LTST-S2200K. Will correct wrong footprint proble.

3.  [X] Investigate moving USB connector forward so that it extends trhu the rear panel. 
        If it extends thru pane, we can change panel cutout back to smaller opening and not block LEDs.

4.  [X] TS-26 switch footprint is mirrored front to back. Fix footprint.
		Footprint corrected, PCB will be updated for D REV. RGB 12/30/14

5. 	[X] Edwin accidentally loaded D1 (optional DNL zener) which caused 5V switcher to develop just 3.84V.
		DNL Inform Edwin, Change BOM
6. 	[X] Change U1 to STM32F405
		Use 407's purchased, use 405's after that. Inform Edwin.
		
7. 	[X] Can't fit PCB into enclosure bottom with R46 volume control fitted.
		Edwin didn't use Bourns POTs. Order Bourns & inform Edwin.
		
8. 	[X] Not sure about tactile feel/quality of trim pots.  They seem to have varying tension/stifness and I can't seat a screwdriver properly in R52.  I can rotate mic gain pot all the way around.
        + Action change to Bourns 3361 trimport
        [X] BOM changed
        [X] Edwin informed (maybe via new BOM)

9. 	[ ] Why are parts designators on overlay missing?  Rubbed off with cleaning?
		Handle offline with Edwin.

10. [X] Assembly instruction: J3 needs to be loaded and jumper inserted
		Schematics changed to show jumper positions.

11. [X] Microphone pins are swapped, ie rotate by 180 degrees.
		Footprint changed to correct problem. Implemented in REV D PCB.
		
12. [O] Should R46 be log?  Last half of travel makes very little difference to subjective volume.
		Defer decision til later.
		
13. [O]	With bud type headphones, a low volume leve is reqd.  At these
		levels some low freq noises at the frame rate and HF hiss can be
		heard.  As these noises are still heard with zero volume its
		probably noise from U8.  Might need soem HP/LP filtering.  Thru
		loudspeaker fine.  Amount of noise varies with headphones used. As
		volume is hard to regulate perhaps another option si a series
		resistor with the headphone jack.
		Defer until more testing done.

14. [O] Decide if power supply and USB programming cable should be included in BOM.
		Defer decision.
		
15. [O] Artwork (i.e. a coloured sleeve) for the box?  Price?  Who can design artwork?
        + add good looking images of board
		Defer action.

16. [X] Change C33 from 100nF to 220nF, to bring HPF corner frequency down.
		Implemented REV D.
		
17. [X] Change Mic1 to Digikey part rather than generic subsitute
    + Generic part resulted in "tinny" audio
    + Digikey part fixed audio, sounded similar to Yaseu MH31
		Mic OK, No Change.
		
18. [X] Confirm on/off power switch parts used is loose sample Edwin packed with the Qty 2 prototypes.
		Switch not used. Stay with currrent switch.
		
19. [X] Choose and order new PTT switch
		Selected Multicomp 8US8WR2C2M7RES for PTT.
		
20. [X] Should we DNL two power leds that aren't exposed via enclosure?
		Use parts Edwin has for currrent build. DNL for future production.
		
21. [X] Confirm with pot part Edwin R46 part used
		Bourns POTs ordered.
22. [ ] Confirm PTT and power switch have buttons (if rqd) and R46 pot has knob on BOM

23. [X] Round or square hole for power switch? 
		Power switch cap or button - use round part Edwin supplied with prototypes.
		
24. [ ] Communciate to Edwin 
        [X] DNL power LEDs
        [ ] knob for Bourns pot, round shaft with set screw
			TODO
        [X] round cap for power switch
        [X] Bourns trimmers
        [X] J3 and jumper loaded

1. [ ] Should R46 be log?  Last half of travel makes very little difference to subjective volume.
2. [ ] Item 13 above, noise from LM386
3. [ ] Wiki with common pin outs of CN12
   [ ] label schematic near CN12 to make working out nets easier    
   [ ] examples of how to connect grounds when AF out is on RJ45
   [ ] Matt " for fat fingers rather fiddly"
       + can we make it larger?    
   [ ] labels near R52, R47, R42, R46 on sch that match overlay and enclosure
