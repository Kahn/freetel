1. Change labels on top overlay near trimmers
   [ ] SPKR IN -> RIG SPKR
   [ ] EXT MIC -> MIC GAIN
   [ ] Remove INT MIC label (it's not associated with a trimmer)
		INT MIC  Identifies internal microphone. Will move to remove confusion. RGB 12/30/14
   
2.  [ ]  Change LED8 to LTST-S2200K. Will correct wrong footprint proble.

3.  [ ] Investigate moving USB connector forward so that it extends trhu the rear panel. 
        If it extends thru pane, we can change panel cutout back to smaller opening and not block LEDs.

4.  [ ] TS-26 switch footprint is mirrored front to back. Fix footprint.
		Footprint corrected, PCB will be updated for D REV. RGB 12/30/14

5. 	[ ] Edwin accidentally loaded D1 (optional DNL zener) which caused 5V switcher to develop just 3.84V.

6. 	[ ] Change U1 to STM32F405

7. 	[ ] Can't fit PCB into enclosure bottom with R46 volume control fitted.

8. 	[ ] Not sure about tactile feel/quality of trim pots.  They seem to have varying tension/stifness and I can't seat a screwdriver properly in R52.  I can rotate mic gain pot all the way around.
        + Action change to Bourns 3361 trimport
        [ ] BOM changed
        [ ] Edwin informed (maybe via new BOM)

9. 	[ ] Why are parts designators on overlay missing?  Rubbed off with cleaning?

10. [ ] Assembly instruction: J3 needs to be loaded and jumper inserted

11. [ ] Microphone pins are swapped, ie rotate by 180 degrees.

12. [ ] Should R46 be log?  Last half of travel makes very little difference to subjective volume.

13. [ ]	With bud type headphones, a low volume leve is reqd.  At these
		levels some low freq noises at the frame rate and HF hiss can be
		heard.  As these noises are still heard with zero volume its
		probably noise from U8.  Might need soem HP/LP filtering.  Thru
		loudspeaker fine.  Amount of noise varies with headphones used. As
		volume is hard to regulate perhaps another option si a series
		resistor with the headphone jack.

14. [ ] Decide if power supply and USB programming cable should be included in BOM.

15. [ ] Artwork (i.e. a coloured sleeve) for the box?  Price?  Who can design artwork?

16. [ ] Change C33 from 100nF to 220nF, to bring HPF corner frequency down.

17. [ ] Change Mic1 to Digikey part rather than generic subsitute
    + Generic part resulted in "tinny" audio
    + Digikey part fixed audio, sounded similar to Yaseu MH31
    
18. [ ] Confirm on/off power switch parts used is loose sample Edwin packed with the Qty 2 prototypes.

19. [ ] Choose and order new PTT switch

20. [ ] Should we DNL two power leds that aren't exposed via enclosure?

21. [ ] Confirm with pot part Edwin R46 part used

22. [ ] Confirm PTT and power switch have buttons (if rqd) and R46 pot has knob on BOM
