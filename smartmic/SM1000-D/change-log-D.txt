1. Change labels on top overlay near trimmers
   [ ] SPKR IN -> RIG SPKR
   [ ] EXT MIC -> MIC GAIN
   [ ] Remove INT MIC label (it's not associated with a trimmer)
   
2.  [ ]  Change LED8 to LTST-S2200K. Will correct wrong footprint proble.

3.  [ ] Investigate moving USB connector forward so that it extends trhu the rear panel. 
        If it extends thru pane, we can change panel cutout back to smaller opening and not block LEDs.

4.  [ ] TS-26 switch footprint is mirrored front to back. Fix footprint.

5. [ ] Edwin accidentally loaded D1 (optional DNL zener) which caused 5V switcher to develop just 3.84V.

6. [ ] Change U1 to STM32F405

7. [ ] Can't fit PCB into enclosure bottom with R46 volume control fitted.

8. [ ] Not sure about tactile feel/quality of trim pots.  They seem to have varying tension/stifness and I can't seat a screwdriver properly in R52.  I can rotate mic gain pot all the way around.

9. [ ] Why are parts designators on overlay missing?  Rubbed off with cleaning?

10. [ ] Assembly instruction: J3 needs to be loaded and jumper inserted

11. [ ] Microphone pins are swapped, ie rotate by 180 degrees.

12. [ ] Should R46 be log?  Last half of travel makes very little difference to subjective volume.

13. [ ] With bud type headphones, a low volume leve is reqd.  At these
    levels some low freq noises at the frame rate and HF hiss can be
    heard.  As these noises are still heard with zero volume its
    probably noise from U8.  Might need soem HP/LP filtering.  Thru
    loudspeaker fine.  Amount of noise varies with headphones used. As
    volume is hard to regulate perhaps another option si a series
    resistor with the headphone jack.

14. [ ] Decide if power supply and USB programming cable should be included in BOM.

15. [ ] Artwork (i.e. a coloured sleeve) for the box?  Price?  Who can design artwork?
