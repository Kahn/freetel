Introduction
------------

The SM1000 is an embedded hardware product that allows you to run
FreeDV without a PC. Just plug it into your SSB or FM radio, and you
now have Digital Voice (DV). It’s based on a STM32F4 micro-controller,
has a built in microphone, speaker amplifier, and transformer isolated
interfaces to your radio. It’s about the size of a smart phone, and
can be held in you hand and used like a regular PTT microphone, or sit
near your radio in a small box. SmartMic is slated for production
production in 2014 and will retail for US$195.

The SM1000 is open hardware (TAPR license) and runs open software
(LGPL license).

Notes
------

The original name for the project was SmartMic.  However as this name
is tradmarked in the USA we are now calling the project "the
SM1000".

The SM1000 schematic and PCB are design using Eagle.

The firmware lives in codec-dev/stm32.
