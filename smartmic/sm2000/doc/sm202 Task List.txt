[ ] Goals
    [ ] Demonstrate TDMA repeater
    [ ] superior weak signal performance (-135dBm)
    [ ] diversity to handle multipath
    [ ] wideband audio
    [ ] high bit rate data
    [ ] low cost
    [ ] Full SDR so we can define waveform
    [ ] SSB up and down converters to allow full waveform control
    [ ] no SoCs

[ ] RF Specs
    + these are targets, main goals are functional, leave
      others to get sparkling RF performance
    [ ] spurious tx emissions -45dBC @ 1W
    [ ] IP3 10dBm
    [ ] Blocking 95dB
    [ ] System NF 2dB
    [ ] ACS 50dB, 
    [ ] MDS (1200Hz) -135dBm, 
    [ ] Tx phase noise -124dBc/Hz ??

[ ] Parts Selection
    [ ] New audio amp chip
        + bit better, higher power than LM386
    [ ] should we add a LCD?
        + how would this be used? 
    [ ] General purpose VHF transistors
    [X] 1st mixer: ADE-1 
    [ ] RF switches
    [ ] 1W PA transistor
    [ ] LCD
    [ ] encoder
    [ ] first LO: Si5351
        + also 2nd LO
        [ ] optional Si570
            + low phase noise soldered in option, provide footprint
            + Si5351 still used as 2nd LO
            [ ] how to select Si570?
                + jumper 0hm resistor?

[ ] Use Cases
    [ ] VHF FM radio
    [ ] Open Source VHF DV radio
        [ ] Low MDS
    [ ] TDMA Repeater
    [ ] Setting frequencu and mode
        + how to select frequency?  What combinations of buttons
          and encoder.
        + do we need a full 0-9 keyboard?
        + should we use a PC or remote device as primary input device
        + does position of buttons/encoders/style of buttons make it easy 
          to use, e.g. set a frequency

[ ] Risks
    + and experiments/tasks/prototypes to mitigate
    [ ] DAC and ADC tied together
        + demo tx/rx switching using this approach
    [ ] Can we use ADE-1 bir-directional?
        + what about diplexor?
    [ ] Investigate use of other mixers
        + but doesnt have to be perfect?
