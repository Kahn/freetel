Unorg notes
-----------

What we care about:

+ Software defined waveform (even linear ones like PSK), so must be
  linear up and down conversion, eg. direct FM is out
+ TDMA so needs a uC with bare metal, no USB and Host PC type devices due
  to latenecies
+ Functional demos of advanced features
+ Your idea is you are willing to roll up you sleaves and make it happen.

What we don't care about:

Other people are good the aspects below, we are not.  So we focus
where we can make a difference, like innovateive coding, good modems,
a new codec, and open source. We are doing enough!  Don't have to
a tick all boxes first time around.

+ minimal cost
+ your favourite radio architecture - there are many ways to up and down convert a signal.
+ High RF performance, such as phase noise, blocking, ACR, high tx
  power, multi-band operation, low spurious, component selection, low
  power consumption.
+ Your favourite chipset
+ Your idea unless you are willing to roll up you sleeves and make it
  happen.
+ gold plating - is the feature you are proposing going to add to our
  schedule?  Will it introduce risk?
