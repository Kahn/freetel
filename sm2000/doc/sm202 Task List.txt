[ ] RF Specs
    + these are targets, main goals are functional, leave
      others to get sparkling RF performance
    [ ] spurious tx emissions -45dBC @ 1W
    [ ] IP3 10dBm

    [ ] Tx phase noise -124dBc/Hz ??

[ ] Parts Selection
    [ ] New audio amp chip
        + bit better, higher power than LM386
    [ ] should we add a LCD?
        + how would this be used? 
        + Could use cheap Nokia 5110, at least in first rev. Well documented and libraried.
    [ ] General purpose VHF transistors
    [X] 1st mixer: ADE-1 
    [ ] RF switches
        + Brady has suggest AS17992LF
    [ ] 1W PA transistor
    [ ] LCD
    [ ] encoder
    [ ] first LO: Si5351
        + also 2nd LO
        [ ] optional Si570
            + low phase noise soldered in option, provide footprint
            + Si5351 still used as 2nd LO
            [ ] how to select Si570?
                + jumper 0hm resistor?

[ ] Use Cases
    [ ] VHF FM radio
    [ ] Open Source VHF DV radio
        [ ] Low MDS

    [ ] Diversity rx
        + use 2nd output from 5351
    [ ] Setting frequency and mode
        + how to select frequency?  What combinations of buttons
          and encoder.
        + do we need a full 0-9 keyboard?
        + should we use a PC or remote device as primary input device
        + does position of buttons/encoders/style of buttons make it easy 
          to use, e.g. set a frequency

[ ] Risks
    + and experiments/tasks/prototypes to mitigate
    [ ] DAC and ADC tied together
        + demo tx/rx switching using this approach
    [ ] Can we use ADE-1 bir-directional?
        + what about diplexor?
    [ ] Investigate use of other mixers
        + but doesnt have to be perfect?

    [ ] what else wcould er use instead of NE602?
    [ ] ADC perf
        + SFDR etc, which is why we run it as 100kHz
        + if not good enough we'll need an external ADC
        + test against two tone, MDS and ACR
