Goals
=====

To demonstrate advanced VHF/UHF Digital Voice features on an open software and hardware platform.

[ ] feasibility of "$100" TDMA repeater
    + show our radio working as a TDMA repeater without a diplexor
    + temporary mount on hill top, city wide coverage
    + no split so saves spectrum, potentially low cost (to fill coverage gaps easily)
[ ] 10dB weak signal performance gain over analog FM and 1st gen DV
    + "smackdown" video of current state of the art against our solution
[ ] diversity to handle multipath
    + TDMA diversity, switch rx LO quickly
    + demo overcoming large fades
[ ] wideband audio
    + for example use 10dB gain to send 10 kbit/s Skype type audio over channel
[ ] high bit rate data
    + 10 - 100 kbit/s
[ ] low cost
    + several hundred $ sales price
    + approx $100 BOM

Project Workflow
================

Manhatten Prototype -> Sch Entry -> PCB Design -> Load and Test -> Demos
       /\                                               /\
       ||                                               ||
 Proto Modem SW                                      Modem SW
                                                     UI SW
                                                     Driver SW

Themes
======

+ Full SDR so we can define waveform
+ SSB up and down converters to allow full waveform control
+ no SoCs
+ Demos of advanced DV features is "enough".  We don't need
  sparkling performance in other areas such as all RF specs.
