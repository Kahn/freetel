[ ] DR Place C7 much closer to U1. Similar distance to C6 p22.  Maybe
    move C6 and C7 closer if possible. Reduce total area of loop
    through which power supply currents must flow.

[ ] DR swap postions of C1 and C2, C3 and C5, C8 and C9. 10n closer to
    U1 than 100n as smaller cap deals with higher freq currents.  C14
    & C15 OK.

[ ] DR C22 4.7uF footprint small for the tant I hand loaded.  Pls make
    larger.

[ ] DR C114 overlay rotate 180 deg

[ ] DR Indication on overlay on pin 1 of XTAL1 and XTAL2. Two of the
    pins on xtals are connected together (ground pins), I worked out
    orientation using a multimeter.

[ ] DR hole size on all (3 pin, 4 pin, etc) 0.1 inch headers too
    small.  Had to solder headers on top.

[ ] DR On schematic only suggest move R28 and R29 to SCL3/SDA3 nodes
    near U1.  This is not a netlist change, just move on schematic to
    highlight these parts are pullups for entire I2C bus and not just
    U4 which is unlikely to be used.  TBH U4 can be removed.  We have
    internal non volatile storage in U1 and drivers to use it.

[ ] DR XTAL1 and XTAL2 footprints too small, OK for machine assembly
    but too small for hand assembly.  Larger pads please that extend
    beyond the perimiter of the the xtal.

[ ] DR - question to Neil re USB D+ D- differential pair routing
    across PCB, e.g. do they need to be the same length, how close
    together.  Distance from USB connector on SM2000 is several
    inches.  Much closer on SM1000.

[ ] DR - should +12VTXENB/+12VRXENB have pull down R's so that on
    reset they are not floating and +12V rx/tx supply lines are
    disabled?

[ ] DR - change notes above and below L2/L3.  Currently refer to
    L8/L9, should be L2/L3.

[ ] DR - connect p3 of J6 to ground
