Dave added new cgis to use perl instead of sed.
	- sed is broken under busybox 1.4.1
	- perl is working fine.
    - comment.cgi
	- uncomment.cgi
	- setlinekey2.cgi

voip provider page

  Test sip
     - registering successfully with another asterisk box (use host=dynamic)
	 - out bound calls ?
	 - inbound calls ?
  
  Test jazmin
	- do we get a successful registration ?
		fails with none dropbox set ... read in current registration
		fails with mulit changes...leave voip keyword intact (Done)
		
	- can we make outbound voip calls ?
	- are inbound voip calls working ?

(Maybe add in voip line 2 page... later)

 voip line (sip trunk) page is now working.
	- reads settings from sip.conf 
	- there are four options for sip trunk... none, sip, sip with nat, and provider
	- you can change user, password, host, fromuser, and fromdomain
	- these changes get saved back into sip.conf when you press the ok
