See install_gui2.sh

0. ipkg install fping
   ipkg install dropbear
   ipkg install ntp

1. Uncomment cgi support in /etc/lighttpd.conf and restart

2. Add "; mini_ext" tags to 6000 numbers in
   /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf
   /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf.def

3. copy main files to /www/gui2
   i want to leave the original gui intact while developing

4. copy cgi-bin scripts into /www/cgi-bin
