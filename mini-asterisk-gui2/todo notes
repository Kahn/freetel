gui2 install script fixes

1. enable cgi 
	use sed on /etc/lighttpd.conf
	then /etc/init.d/lighttpd restart

2. add mini_ext comments to 60xx numbers 
	use sed on /etc/asterisk/extension.conf


Functionality work

3. firefox  update reception button broken
---------------------------------------------
   Installed firebug debugger
   TypeError
   phones.js line 209
   document.phones.elements['selected_in[]'] undefined ... great
   So how do I code this to work in firefox, chrome and ie?

   I cant see any phones element in the document model.

   Start using html validator at http://validator.w3.org/check

   internet explorer 9 is ok.

4. network page not working
------------------------------
   Also how fast can it detect the internet after change in gateway
   Try to break internet with dns or gateway changes.

5. Outbound calls....
-------------------------

   Groups of people assigned to different outbound
   Work with dialplans
   At present  
      0 gets outside analog line
      1 gets a sip call thru the vsp
   Instead of hard coded 0,1 change to dropbox selection 
   then try assigning to groups.
   Need to have a page where we set up groups of users.

6. ntp testing
--------------------
   try getting ntpclient rather than ntp?
   try setting TZ in /etc/init.d/asterisk already done...just need reboot
   web page for setting timezone (radio button and apply checkbox?)

7. Look at using setline.cgi instead of setring.cgi
   Have setline take care of special cases like escaping the ampersand.

8. Setring.cgi fix
   Remove asterisk -r calls.....do this from javascript with asterisk.cgi.
   
9. Pick up second IP04 for 
	gui2 install testing
	unit testing call generation

General Interest

 IP04 could be redone more simply with a plug computer (mmu) The blackfin has no memory management unit. This causes many problems and cludgey fixes.
