IP04 GUI2 Development notes
Ian Roberts 
Sept 2012


IP04 Environment

	telnet root@192.168.1.30
	ipkg install dropbear           (for ssh access to ip04)
	ipkg install fping 
	ssh root@192.168.1.30
	url:   192.168.1.30


PC Environment 

Packages

	svn		version control
	openssh		communication with ip04
	fping		used to determine internet connection
	chrome    	built-in debugger .... ctrl-shift-i
			install validator extension
	firefox		install extensions firebug debugger and html validator
	lighttpd	minimal webserver
	asterisk-1.4.11 when testing code around asterisk -r calls
			needs to be installed (we need access to the conf files)
			but doesn't have to be running unless testing sip stuff

Source code

	svn co https://freetel.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/freetel/mini-asterisk-gui2

	svn status
	svn diff <file>
	svn add <newfile>
	svn ci <file>
	svn propset executable

	tortoise svn on win7 
	checkout https://freetel.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/freetel/mini-asterisk-gui

lighttpd setup

	point at the mini-asterisk-gui2 directory.
	enable cgi
	see x86 instructions at http://www.rowetel.com/blog/?page_id=455

Asterisk Install

	Install asterisk-1.4.11 from source code
	see x86 instructions at http://www.rowetel.com/blog/?page_id=455

	IP04 runs 1.4.4-1 (2007) with zaptel-sport 1.4.3-2 on a 2.6.19-3 kernel (2006).

	You can ipkg install asterisk-1.4.20 (2008)

	Asterisk 1.4.22 (2008) changed from using zaptel-sport to dahdi.

	Asterisk 1.6.2.7 (2010) uses dahdi 2.3.0

	AsteriskNow (2012) runs Asterisk 1.8.11 with Dahdi 2.6.1 on a 2.6.18-308 kernel


Asterisk conf files


	copy the following files from the gui2 source to /etc on the pc.

	gui2/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf  to 	/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf
	gui2/etc/asterisk/sip.conf	   to	/etc/asterisk/sip.conf
	gui2/etc/asterisk/zapata.conf	   to	/etc/asterisk/zapata.conf
	gui2/etc/asterisk/iax.conf	   to 	/etc/asterisk/iax.conf

	and

	gui2/etc/zaptel.conf to /etc/zaptel.conf


browser

	url :   127.0.0.1/phones.html



Method

	Svn co code to PC gui2 directory
	Point local web server at gui2 directory and enable cgi
	Test on PC with 127.0.0.1/gui2/phones.html
	Svn ci changes.
	
	
	telnet IP04 pristine build or ssh to modified IP04 (dropbear)
	Install gui2 from root directory
	   sh install_gui2.sh
	
	Test on IP04 with 192.168.1.30/gui2/phones.html




Specific Tasks

fping 
	check reaction times 

network 
	test write properties

sys info 
	format and paging

reception 
	Incoming calls are switched to a handset defined in /etc/extensions.conf

	exten => s,1,Dial(Zap/4&SIP/6011) ;; mini-asterisk - don't remove this comment

	In this case, the analog handset hanging off Zap/4, and the sip hanset 6011

	I had to use a static html button for reception update. 
	The dynamic created button failed to fire setring.cgi

	Setring.cgi : escaping the & works on the IP04 but fails on devel pc.... linux mint. 
	sed on diff platforms?

Install script
	Done....install_gui2.sh

Simple Switch button for GUI2 or original.
	The GUIs can coexist. Should have the option of switching.

	 port the Oslec echo sampling code to the Blackfin

	When I was developing the Oslec echo canceller I patched Zaptel to allow sampling of echo signals:
	http://www.rowetel.com/ucasterisk/oslec.html#sample
	With these samples I can usally diagnose echo problems, for example an obvious hardware problem, large or variable delays, a bad PSTN line or (rarely these days) Oslec falling over.
	However I only ever ran the sampling code on x86 platforms, it was never ported to the Blackfin as there have been very few echo problems with the IP0X.
	I don't have the time for this myself, but if some one would like to port the Oslec echo sampling code to the Blackfin I would be happy to take a look at the samples and help diagnose the echo problems.  The link above explains what is involved (some patches to Zaptel and a user mode program).

ntp page
	ipkg install ntp
	setting times.
	Configuring ntp?

	root:~> ipkg files ntp
	Package ntp (4.1.1-1) is installed on root and has the following files:
	/bin/ntpd
	/bin/ntpdate
	/etc/init.d/ntp
	/usr/doc/ntp.txt

	 NOTES:

	 1. Set the /etc/TZ file for your timezone

	 2. The TZ env variable in your shell will set the current
	    time zone.  This gets set automatically via /etc/profile
	    for console and ssh logins, but for some reason it is not
	    set in telnet logins (maybe because they currently don't
	    have a proper login).

	 3. List of magic TZ codes here (thanks Mike Taht):
		http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Configuration
		(search on TZ)

	 4. It's a really good idea to install the login ipkg (ipkg install
	    login), otherwise TZ doesn't get set correctly at the start of
	    each telnet session.  Without login TZ gets set only on the
	    serial console and ssh logins.
