LICENSING

Copyright (C) Algoram.

This program is dual-licensed. You can purchase a commercial license from
Algoram. We use commercial licensing to fund the further development
of Free Software, and we make each version of this program available under
both a commercial license and the Affero GPL Version 3. If you have not
explicitly purchased a commercial license from us, the terms of the Affero
GPL Version 3 apply to this program.

You are welcome to incorporate this program into commercial products under
the Affero GPL Version 3, but you must comply with all of its terms, including
those that require you to publish the source code of your own software
under a compatible license.

Alternatively, you may purchase a commercial license from Algoram, in which
case you need not publish your own source code. Be advised that Algoram does
not own the entire copyright of this program, specifically the codec library.
The portions of this program that we do not own are under less restrictive
licenses like LGPL version 2, and we will work with your attorney and engineers
to help you to deal with the intellectual property due diligence requirements
of those licenses in a way that protects you from being obligated to publish
your own source code.

Algoram is not a law firm and in general we work with your attorney. Only your
attorney can provide you with legal advice.

Contributions to this software must be handled specially due to the dual
licensing. We request that developers sign all rights in their modifications
over to us by sending us their contribution along with this statement:

	I swear that this addition or modification to an existing program
	is my original work, and that I have the right to convey the rights
	in this work. I convey all rights in this work to Algoram.
	- your-name-here.

In return, we commit to continue to release subsequent development
of this program under The Affero GPL Version 3 or a less restrictive license
for a period of three years from your contribution, or we will remove your
contribution from our version. We feel that our committment to continuation of
Free Software development is an appropriate reward for developer contributions.
