<li><strong>Where can I get Support:</strong> You can try the
    <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/freetel-discuss">Free Telephony Project</a> Mailing List.

<li><strong>Answer a call on another ringing phone</strong>: If you
    hear another phone ringing and want to answer the call on your
    phone, just pick up your phone and dial *8.  Note an IP phone can
    pick up a call on a ringing IP phone but not an Analog phone.  An
    Analog pohone can pick up another ringing Analog phone but not an
    IP phone.

<li><strong>Put a call on hold/transfer:</strong> On an IP Phone try
    the recall or transfer button.  On an Analog Phone hold down the
    hook button for 1 second then dial the new number.

<li><strong>Why another Asterisk GUI</strong> I had some specific
    needs for a light weight, very easy to use GUI for
    the <a href="http://www.rowetel.com/ucasterisk/ip04.html">IP0X</a>
    line of products.  So I scratched the itch.  More
    information <a href="http://www.rowetel.com/ucasterisk/mini.html#why">here</a>.
