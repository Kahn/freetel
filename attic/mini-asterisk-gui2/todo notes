Sept 13 2012

Goal is a gui2 package we can install on an ip0x
  ipkg install gui2
see baps build makefile
http://svn.astfin.org/software/baps/trunk/mini-asterisk-gui.mk

1. install script fix :enable cgi     Done
----------------------------------
	use sed on /etc/lighttpd.conf
	 1. Change end bracket to comma 
	 2. Uncomment s_#cgi.assign.*_cgi.assign
	 3. Add in end bracket
	then /etc/init.d/lighttpd restart
	
	kiss. just copy the corrected conf file from the sourceforge archive.

2.  install script fix :add mini_ext comments Done 
------------------------------------------
	use sed on /etc/asterisk/extension.conf

   show extensions missing mini_ext comment
 	grep "60**" /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf | grep -v "mini"

	grep "60[0-9][0-9],1,Dial(.*) " /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf


3. on firefox : update reception button broken   Done 14/9
---------------------------------------------
   Chrome 21 is ok
   Internet Explorer 9 is ok. 
   IE 8? - check on vista laptop
   Safari 5.1.7 is ok
   Firefox 15 fails ...why?.
   Installed firebug debugger
   TypeError
   phones.js line 209
   document.phones.elements['selected_in[]'] undefined ... 

   I cant see any phones element in the document model.

		 
	David --> Try moving <form> to encapsulate the <table> in phones.js
	
	This worked.

4. network page not working       Not done
------------------------------
   Also how fast can it detect the internet after change in gateway
   Try to break internet with dns or gateway changes.
   Missing a cgi.....setservice.cgi
   
   Calls from network.js are 
   if (document.network.dhcp.value == "yes") {

	if (dhcp = "no") {
	    // disable network-state service and endable network service
	    downloadUrl("/cgi-bin/setservice.cgi?action=enabledhcp",null);
	}
	else {
	    // dhcp already running, restart service
	    downloadUrl("/cgi-bin/setservice.cgi?action=restartdhcp",null);
	}
    }
    else {

	if (dhcp = "yes") {
	    // disable network service and enable network-static service
	    downloadUrl("/cgi-bin/setservice.cgi?action=enablestatic",null);
	}

	.....
	
	if (document.network.backdoor.value != backdoor) {
	    var new_ = document.network.backdoor.value;
	    var url = '/cgi-bin/setline.cgi?file=/etc/init.d/network-backup&this=BACKDOOR=&that="' + new_backdoor + '"';
	    downloadUrl(url,null);
    	    downloadUrl("/cgi-bin/setservice.cgi?action=restartbackup",null);
	}

	// finally restart network-static service with new parameters

    	downloadUrl("/cgi-bin/setservice.cgi?action=restartstatic",null);
    }

	Are URLs with null return  function suppose to be synchronous?
	
	The networking functions have to have synchrous sections, esp when start/stop/enable/disable
	
	For example, u cant do a network start before a network stop has finished?
	
	Try to synchronise with cascading cgi flow. This works.
	
	Need to time-out fping after 2-3seconds, else it will go 30s.
   
   
   

5. Outbound calls....
-------------------------

   Groups of people assigned to different outbound
   Work with dialplans
   At present  
      0 gets outside analog line
      1 gets a sip call thru the vsp
   Instead of hard coded 0,1 maybe use a dropbox selection 
   then try assigning to groups of users.
   Need to have a page where we set up groups of users.

6. ntp testing
--------------------
   try getting ntpclient rather than ntp?
   try setting TZ in /etc/init.d/asterisk already done...just need reboot
   web page for setting timezone (radio button and apply checkbox?)

7. use setline.cgi instead of setring.cgi
--------------------------------------
   Have setline take care of special cases like escaping the ampersand.

8. Setring.cgi fix    Done 14/9
--------------------
   Remove asterisk -r calls from setring.cgi.....do this from javascript with asterisk.cgi.
   
9. Pick up second IP04
----------------------------
	gui2 install testing
	unit testing call generation
	
10. Move formatting from html to css
---------------------------------------
     html <table align="center" width=800>
     css
	 
11.	Add some formatting (carriage returns) to the table element in phones.js	 
-------------------------------------------------------

 IP04 could be redone more simply with a plug computer. $150 - $250AU

 1.2GHz ARM 512M ddr2 512M flash sd boot 2x usb 2x cat5  5W ..... good ip-pbx? good smoothwall or snorby box?
 Need some sort of USB to FXO to hook up to analog phone lines.
 $150 http://sangoma.com/products/telecom_boards/analog/usbfxo/specs.html
 $20 gets you a skype gateway box with an fxo

 The blackfin has no memory management unit. This causes many problems and cludgey fixes.
